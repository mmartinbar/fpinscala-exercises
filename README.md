This repository contains my solutions to the exercises proposed at the [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) book by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason.

**Disclaimer:** These solutions may be not the best ones (I'm doing these exercises as a way to learn both Scala and FP concepts). For the official solutions to the exercises, please take a look at their [github](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala).
